# Reflection

- Some of the actual time are longer or shorter than the estimates. If the program was a simple one, it might take shorter,
but if the program is a long one, it might take a long time.
- During code reviews, I realize that it is easy to forget to add docstring description on the function, and the standard
writing style of python (PEP 8)
- There was one long one problem that was like an assignment that was troublesome to tackle but I also think it is a good
practice for a real assignment, but besides that the practical questions are ok and manageable
