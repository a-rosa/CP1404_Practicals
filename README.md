# CP1404 Practical
by: Amelia Rosalind

## Introduction
This repository includes files for problems in CP1404 practicals. Each week have their own files with their own problems.
The problem can be found in: https://github.com/CP1404/Practicals

## Clean code
Things I learned about clean code:
- Each function should have their own docstring that tells what it does
- Use the correct naming convention
- Make use of function to not repeat the same code
